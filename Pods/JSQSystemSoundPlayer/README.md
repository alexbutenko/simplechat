# JSQSystemSoundPlayer 
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jessesquires/JSQSystemSoundPlayer.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/jessesquires/JSQSystemSoundPlayer) [![Version Status](http://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/JSQSystemSoundPlayer.png)][docsLink] [![license MIT](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-orange.png)][mitLink]

A fancy Obj-C wrapper for iOS [System Sound Services](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AudioToolbox/Reference/SystemSoundServicesReference/Reference/reference.html).

This class is a light-weight, drop-in component to play sound effects, or other short sounds in your iOS app. 
To determine your audio needs, see [Best Practices for iOS Audio](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/DOCUMENTATION/AudioVideo/Conceptual/MultimediaPG/UsingAudio/UsingAudio.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009767-CH2-SW10).
Or, read the tl;dr version:

>*When your sole audio need is to play alerts and user-interface sound effects, use Core Audioâ€™s System Sound Services.*
>
>Your sound files must be:
>
>* No longer than 30 seconds in duration
>* In linear PCM or IMA4 (IMA/ADPCM) format
>* Packaged in a `.caf`, `.aif`, or `.wav` file

If this does not fit your needs, then this control is not for you! 
See [AVAudioPlayer](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/DOCUMENTATION/AVFoundation/Reference/AVAudioPlayerClassReference/Reference/Reference.html), instead.

## Features

* Play sound effects and alert sounds with a single line of code
* "Play" vibration (if available on device)
* Block-based completion handlers
* Integration with `NSUserDefaults` to globally toggle sound effects in your app
* Sweet and efficient memory management
* Caches sounds (`SystemSoundID` objects) and purges on memory warning

## Requirements

* iOS 6.0+ 
* ARC

## Installation

````
pod 'JSQSystemSoundPlayer'
````
Otherwise, drag the `JSQSystemSoundPlayer/` folder to your project, and add `AudioToolbox.framework`.

## Getting Started

````objective-c
[[JSQSystemSoundPlayer sharedPlayer] playSoundWithName:@"mySoundFile"
                                             extension:kJSQSystemSoundTypeAIF
                                            completion:^{
                                                // completion block code
                                            }];
````

And that's all! 

String constants for file extensions provided for you: 
* `kJSQSystemSoundTypeCAF`
* `kJSQSystemSoundTypeAIF`
* `kJSQSystemSoundTypeAIFF`
* `kJSQSystemSoundTypeWAV`

Need a setting in your app's preferences to toggle sound effects on/off? `JSQSystemSoundPlayer` can do that, too! There's no need to ever check the saved settings (`[JSQSystemSoundPlayer sharedPlayer].on`) before you play a sound effect. Just play a sound like in the example above. `JSQSystemSoundPlayer` respects whatever setting has been previously saved.

````objective-c
[[JSQSystemSoundPlayer sharedPlayer] toggleSoundPlayerOn:YES];
````

Also see the included demo project: `SoundPlayerDemo.xcodeproj`

_**For a good time:**_
````objective-c
while (1) {
    [[JSQSystemSoundPlayer sharedPlayer] playVibrateSound];
}
````
